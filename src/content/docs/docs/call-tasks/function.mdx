## Purpose

The generic `Call` task enables the execution of a specified, named function within a workflow. This allows seamless integration with custom business logic, reusable workflow components, or functions defined externally (e.g., in a [Resource Catalog](/docs/resources-configuration/resource-catalog/)).

*Note: This describes the generic function call using a function name. For specific protocol interactions like HTTP, gRPC, OpenAPI, or AsyncAPI, refer to their dedicated task pages.*

## Usage Example

```yaml
document:
  dsl: '1.0.0'
  namespace: custom-functions
  name: call-custom-example
  version: '1.0.0'
use:
  functions:
    validateAddress:
      call: expression
      with:
        code: |
          function validateAddress(street, city, zipCode) {
            // Basic validation logic
            if (!street || !city || !zipCode) {
              return { valid: false, error: "Missing required fields" };
            }
            // Additional validation logic here
            return { valid: true, normalized: { street, city, zipCode } };
          }
do:
  - checkAddress:
      call: validateAddress
      with:
        street: "${ .customer.address.street }"
        city: "${ .customer.address.city }"
        zipCode: "${ .customer.address.zip }"
      # Output of the 'validateAddress' function becomes output of this task
  - processValidationResult:
      switch:
        - caseValid:
            when: "${ .checkAddress.valid }"
            then: setNormalizedAddress
        - default:
            then: raiseValidationError
  - setNormalizedAddress:
      set:
        normalizedAddress: "${ .checkAddress.normalized }"
      then: exit
  - raiseValidationError:
      raise:
        error:
          type: "https://example.com/errors/validation"
          status: 400
          detail: "${ .checkAddress.error }"
      then: exit
          
```

In this example, the `checkAddress` task calls a function named `validateAddress`, passing arguments derived from the current context or input using the `with` property.

## Additional Examples

### Example: Calling a Function with No Arguments

```yaml
do:
  - triggerProcessing:
      # Assumes 'startBackgroundJob' function requires no specific arguments
      call: startBackgroundJob 
      # No 'with' property needed
  - monitorJob:
      # ...
```

### Example: Calling a Catalog Function

```yaml
# Assumes 'globalUtils' catalog is imported via workflow.use.catalogs
# Assumes 'logMessage:1.0' function exists in that catalog
do:
  - recordInfo:
      call: logMessage:1.0@globalUtils # Function:Version@CatalogName
      with:
        level: INFO
        message: "Processed item ${ .itemId }"
```

## Configuration Options

### `call` (String, Required)

Specifies the **name** of the function to execute. This name must correspond to:

*   A function defined in the workflow's `use.functions` section.
*   A function available from an imported [Resource Catalog](/docs/resources-configuration/resource-catalog/).
*   A built-in function provided by the runtime (like `http`, `grpc`, etc., although using their specific task pages is recommended).

### `with` (Object, Optional)

A simple key/value map defining the arguments to pass to the called function. Values can be static or derived using [Runtime Expressions](/docs/core-concepts/runtime-expressions/).

### Authentication

The generic function `call` task itself does not have a dedicated `authentication` property within its `with` block. If the function being called requires authentication to perform its internal operations, that logic must be handled *inside* the function's implementation (potentially using secrets or context passed via `with`).

If the function *definition* itself is hosted in a protected location (like a secured [Resource Catalog](/docs/resources-configuration/resource-catalog/)), authentication would be configured on the catalog's `endpoint` definition, not on the `call` task.

**Error Handling**: If authentication fails while trying to *access the function definition* from a protected catalog, the runtime should raise an `Authentication` or `Authorization` error related to accessing the catalog endpoint. Errors related to authentication *within* the called function's logic are the responsibility of the function itself to handle or raise appropriately.

### Data Flow

<CommonTaskDataFlow />
**Note**:
*   The `transformedInput` to the `Call` task is available for use within runtime expressions in the `with` arguments.
*   The `rawOutput` of the `Call` task is the result returned by the executed function.
*   Standard `output.as` and `export.as` process this function result.
