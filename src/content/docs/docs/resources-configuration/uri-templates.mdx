## Purpose

URI Templates provide a limited mechanism for creating dynamic URIs within the Serverless Workflow DSL, based on
variable substitution. They are primarily used in places where a URI needs to be constructed based on available data,
such as defining the endpoint for an HTTP `call`.

This feature is based on [RFC 6570](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570) but supports only a small subset of
its capabilities.

## Supported Syntax: Simple String Expansion

The only syntax supported is **Simple String Expansion**: `{variableName}`.

* The workflow runtime identifies placeholders enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
* It looks for a variable with the exact name specified inside the braces (e.g., `variableName`) within the current data
  context.
* It replaces the entire `{variableName}` placeholder with the **value** of that variable.
* If no variable with that exact name is found, the placeholder is replaced with an **empty string**.

```yaml
# Example in an HTTP call
call: http
with:
  uri: "https://api.example.com/users/{userId}/profile"
  # Assumes a variable named 'userId' exists in the data context
  # If userId is "abc", the final URI becomes:
  # https://api.example.com/users/abc/profile 
```

## Limitations Compared to Runtime Expressions (`${...}`)

URI Templates are **much less powerful** than standard [Runtime Expressions](/docs/core-concepts/runtime-expressions/). Key
limitations include:

1. **No Dot Notation:** You cannot access nested properties within variables (e.g., `{user.id}` is invalid for accessing
   `id` within a `user` object). The template processor looks for a variable literally named `user.id`. You must ensure
   the required value exists as a top-level variable (e.g., use `{userId}` instead).
2. **Restricted Variable Types:** The variable referenced inside `{}` **must** resolve to a `string`, `number`,
   `boolean`, or `null`. Using variables that resolve to objects or arrays will result in an error.
3. **No Access to Workflow Arguments:** You **cannot** use special workflow arguments like `$context`, `$task`,
   `$input`, `$output`, or `$secrets` inside `{}` placeholders. Use standard Runtime Expressions (`${...}`) when you
   need access to these.

```yaml
# --- INVALID USAGE --- 
# uri: "https://api.example.com/data/{$context.requestPath}" # Cannot use $context
# uri: "https://api.example.com/items/{item.id}" # Cannot use dot notation

# --- VALID USAGE (using Runtime Expression instead) --- 
# uri: "${ \"https://api.example.com/data/\" + $context.requestPath }" 
```

Choose URI Templates only for very simple substitutions where the limitations are acceptable. For more complex URI
construction or access to workflow context, use standard Runtime Expressions.

## Error Handling

If a variable referenced within a URI Template resolves to an unsupported type (like an object or array), the workflow *
*must** fault with an error:

* **`type`**: `https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/expression`
* **`status`**: `400` (Bad Request)
