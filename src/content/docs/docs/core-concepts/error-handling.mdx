## Purpose

Failures and exceptional conditions are inevitable in any complex system. The Serverless Workflow DSL provides robust
mechanisms to define, raise, identify, and handle errors gracefully.

This ensures workflows can:

* Recover from anticipated issues
* Perform compensation logic
* Implement retries for transient problems
* Avoid abrupt termination for manageable faults

## Error Definition (Problem Details)

Errors in Serverless Workflow are structured based on
the [RFC 7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807). This provides a
standardized way to communicate error information.

The core fields of a workflow error object are:

* **`type`** (String, Required): A URI reference that identifies the specific type of error. The specification defines
  several [Standard Error Types](#standard-error-types)
* **`status`** (Integer, Required): The status code associated with this occurrence of the error (often analogous to
  HTTP status codes)
* **`title`** (String, Optional): A short, human-readable summary of the error
* **`detail`** (String, Optional): A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the error
* **`instance`** (String, Required): A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem. In
  Serverless Workflow, this is typically a [JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) indicating the
  specific task or component within the workflow definition where the error originated (e.g., `/do/1/callApi`)

See `com.lemline.core.errors.WorkflowError.kt` for the corresponding data class.

## Standard Error Types

The specification defines standard error `type` URIs for common issues. Runtimes **must** use these types when
applicable to ensure consistent behavior. Authors should use these when defining custom errors for similar conditions.

Base URI: `https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/`

| Type Suffix      | Default Status | Description                                                                  | Implementation (`WorkflowErrorType`) |
|:-----------------|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| `configuration`  | 400            | Problem with the workflow definition itself (e.g., invalid `then` target)    | `CONFIGURATION`                      |
| `validation`     | 400            | Input/output data failed schema validation (`input.schema`, `output.schema`) | `VALIDATION`                         |
| `expression`     | 400            | Evaluation of a runtime expression failed (e.g., syntax error, bad access)   | `EXPRESSION`                         |
| `authentication` | 401            | Authentication failed when accessing a protected resource                    | `AUTHENTICATION`                     |
| `authorization`  | 403            | Insufficient permissions to access a resource (e.g., secrets)                | `AUTHORIZATION`                      |
| `timeout`        | 408            | A configured workflow or task timeout was exceeded                           | `TIMEOUT`                            |
| `communication`  | 500            | Error during communication with an external service (e.g., HTTP call fail)   | `COMMUNICATION`                      |
| `runtime`        | 500            | General runtime error not covered by other types                             | `RUNTIME`                            |

## Raising Errors

Errors can enter the system in two main ways:

1. **Implicitly by the Runtime**: The workflow engine raises standard errors automatically when certain conditions
   occur:
    * Expression evaluation fails (`expression` error)
    * Schema validation fails (`validation` error)
    * A task or workflow times out (`timeout` error)
    * A `call` task fails due to network issues (`communication` error)
    * Authentication/Authorization issues arise (`authentication`/`authorization` errors)
    * Workflow definition issues are detected (`configuration` error)

2. **Explicitly using the `Raise` Task**: Authors can use the [`Raise` task](/docs/error-handling/raise/) to explicitly throw a
   specific error (either predefined in `use.errors` or defined inline) based on workflow logic:
   ```yaml
   - checkInventory:
       # ... check logic ...
       if: "${ .stock < .needed }"
       raise:
         error: outOfStockError # Defined in use.errors
         with:
           detail: "Needed ${ .needed }, only ${ .stock } available"
   ```

## Catching and Handling Errors (`Try...Catch`)

The primary mechanism for handling errors is the [`Try` task](/docs/error-handling/try/). A `Try` task consists of:

1. A `try` block containing the tasks that might raise errors
2. A `catch` block defining how to handle those errors

```yaml
- myTryTask:
    try:
      # Block of tasks to attempt
      - taskToTry:
        # ... might raise an error ...
    catch:
      # Block defining how to handle errors from 'try'
      errors:
        with:
          type: ".../specificErrorType"  # 1. Filter which errors to catch
      when: "${ $error.instance == '/do/0/taskToTry' }"  # 2. Conditional catch
      as: myError  # 3. Store error object
      retry: myRetryPolicy  # 4. Optionally retry
      do: # 5. Execute compensation logic
        - logError:
            set:
              errorMessage: "${ $myError.detail }"
        - setFallback:
            set:
              status: "error"
              message: "Operation failed: ${ $myError.detail }"
```

### Error Handling Components

1. **Filtering (`catch.errors.with`)**:
    * Specify criteria (`type`, `status`, etc.) to only catch specific errors
    * If omitted, all errors are candidates for catching (subject to `when`/`exceptWhen`)

2. **Conditional Catch (`catch.when`, `catch.exceptWhen`)**:
    * Further refine catching logic using runtime expressions
    * Expressions are evaluated against the error object (available via `catch.as` variable)

3. **Error Access (`catch.as`)**:
    * The caught error object is made available within the `catch` block scope
    * Used in `when`, `exceptWhen`, `retry`, and `do` blocks
    * Default variable name is `$error` if not specified

4. **Retries (`catch.retry`)**:
    * If an error is caught, a retry policy can be defined
    * The retry policy determines how many times to retry and with what delay
    * The *entire* `try` block is re-executed after the delay
    * See [`Try` task documentation](/docs/error-handling/try/) for retry policy details

5. **Compensation (`catch.do`)**:
    * Executed if an error is caught and not retried (or retries are exhausted)
    * Allows for cleanup, logging, or setting fallback values
    * The output of this block becomes the output of the `Try` task

## Error Propagation

Error propagation follows these rules:

1. An error propagates upwards if:
    * It occurs outside any `Try` task, OR
    * It occurs within a `try` block but is *not* matched by the corresponding `catch` filters, OR
    * It is caught but retries are exhausted and there is no `catch.do` block

2. The runtime searches the parent scope for another enclosing `Try` task:
    * If found, the error is handled by the outer `Try` task's logic
    * If not found, the error continues propagating

3. If the error propagates to the top level without being caught:
    * The entire workflow execution **faults**
    * The workflow terminates unsuccessfully
    * The uncaught error is reported in the workflow result
