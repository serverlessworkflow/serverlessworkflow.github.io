🎉 Celebrating the **1.0.0** Release of the Serverless Workflow Specification - Five Years in the Making ! 🎉

It’s been half a decade since the first release of the **Serverless Workflow Specification**, and we’re proud to share our biggest milestone yet: **Version 1.0.0**. This marks a new era of event-driven, function-centric, and service-oriented workflow design—backed by a vibrant community and robust ecosystem.

## ⭐ Key Enhancements and Features ⭐

- ✅ **Unified Task Concept** – Merge states and actions into tasks, simplifying definitions and removing nesting limits.
- ✅ **Easy Function Invocation** – Seamlessly call HTTP, gRPC, OpenAPI, or AsyncAPI services.
- ✅ **Event Driven** – Ingest events for real-time triggers and correlations.
- ✅ **Streaming Support** – Leverage AsyncAPI and CloudEvent subscriptions for continuous data flow.
- ✅ **Fault Tolerance & Timeouts** – Built-in error handling, retries, and timeout management for greater reliability.
- ✅ **Scheduling & Concurrency** – CRON-based triggers and parallel event handling let you run workflows exactly when—and how—you need.
- ✅ **Extensibility** – Extend or override the DSL without writing extra code, ensuring runtime-agnostic portability.
- ✅ **Code Reusability & Maintainability** – Scale effortlessly with cleaner, modular definitions.
- ✅ **Behavior Driven Design** – Gherkin-based features ensure consistent, standardized testing and implementations.
