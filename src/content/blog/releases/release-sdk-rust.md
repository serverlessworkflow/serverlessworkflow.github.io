Hello, Serverless Workflow community!

We are thrilled to announce the release of the very first alpha version of the **Serverless Workflow Rust SDK**! Version `v1.0.0-alpha6` marks an exciting milestone as we bring the power of the Serverless Workflow specification to the Rust ecosystem.

## Installation Instructions

To start using the Rust SDK, simply add it to your projectâ€™s dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
serverless-workflow-sdk = "1.0.0-alpha6"
```

Alternatively, you can add it directly via Cargo:

```bash
cargo add serverless-workflow-sdk@1.0.0-alpha6
```

## Whatâ€™s Included?

This initial alpha release includes:

- **Core Models**: Full support for the Serverless Workflow DSL, enabling you to define workflows in compliance with the specification.
- **Builders**: Programmatic workflow creation using builder patterns for ease and type safety.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

As we move toward the full `v1.0.0` release, our focus will be on:

- Expanding the SDK with additional utilities and helpers.
